## Data Preparation
Some work in R was done to transform data from the original fields to fields that we felt were valuable as predictors for modeling. eg. win efficiency

## Modeling
We investgated random forests, xgboost, neural networks, decision trees and logistic regression over the course of this project. The eventual model chosen was logistic regression.

The R Markdown files (cleaned up) are included. This repository is the final one that contains the submitted findings.
